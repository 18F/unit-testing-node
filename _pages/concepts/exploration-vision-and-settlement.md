title: Exploration, vision, and settlement

As you gain experience with your program, you may develop many different
pieces in a nonlinear fashion. Some of your earlier ideas or understandings
about the problem space may become cruelly overturned by later insights or
harsh experience. This is OK—in fact, it's to be expected. During this
**exploration phase**, your ideas about the problem and solution spaces need
time and space to develop. Be patient with yourself, and don’t become
frustrated if your initial understandings are totally overturned.

Your program may contain parts that are so obvious that you shouldn't hesitate
to test them, even if they eventually need to evolve. When you have a clear
**vision** for part of the program, covering it with tests enables you to
explore the other parts with greater confidence.

That said, it's possible that you might not write tests at all until you gain
confidence that your understanding of the program has matured. You may feel
that investing time in testing behavior your not sure is correct is as like to
prove wasteful as insightful (and you might be right).

When your understanding has matured, it's imperative that you codify it via
automated tests. During this **settlement phase**, you'll be testing the
behavior you're confident will not change radically, upon which you (and
others!) will depend going forward.

The most important thing is that you make sure your program is well tested by
the time anyone depends on it. However, you don't need to feel compelled to
test it exhaustively before you fully understand the requirements or the
nuances of the problem space.
