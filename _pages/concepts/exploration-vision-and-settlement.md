As you gain experience with your program, you may develop many different
pieces in a non-linear fashion. Some of your earlier ideas or understandings
about the problem space may become cruelly overturned by later insight or
harsh experience. This is OK, and to be expected. During this **exploration
phase**, your ideas about the problem and solution spaces need time and space
to develop.

There may be parts of the program that are so obvious that you shouldn't
hesitate to test them, even if they eventually need to evolve. When you have
a clear **vision** for part of the program, covering it with tests enables
you to explore the other parts with greater confidence.

That said, it's possible that you might not write tests at all until you gain
confidence that your understanding of the program has matured. Investing the
time in testing behavior that you're as yet uncertain is the _right_ behavior
may prove wasteful as likely as it may prove insightful.

When that mature understanding _does_ come, _then_ it becomes imperative to
codify that understanding via automated tests. During this **settlement
phase** you're testing the behavior you're confident will not change
radically, upon which you (and others!) will depend going forward.

The most important thing is that your program become well-tested by the time
anyone depends on it. It need not start off that way before you fully
understand the requirements or the nuances of the problem space.
