title: Conclusion

Bear in mind that this exercise came about _after_ the
[settlement phase]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/exploration-vision-and-settlement/)
of the original program. Only in hindsight is it possible to outline the
development process in a linear fashion. In reality, [the
initial outline of the entire application](https://github.com/18F/hubot-slack-github-issues/tree/work-in-progress)
emerged first. This guided the development of the individual parts, which were
tested at every step.

Once the initial version was launched, new insights prompted significant
changes to parts of the program.
