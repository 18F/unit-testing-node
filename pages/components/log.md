If you've skipped to this chapter, you can establish the starting state of the
`exercise/` files for this chapter by running:

```sh
$ ./go set-log
```

## What to expect

## Testing

## Check your work

Now that you're all finished, compare your solutions to the code in
[`solutions/04-log/lib/github-client.js`]({{ site.baseurl }}/solutions/04-log/lib/github-client.js)
and
[`solutions/04-log/test/github-client-test.js`]({{ site.baseurl }}/solutions/04-log/test/github-client-test.js).

You may wish to `git commit` your work to your local repo at this point. After
doing so, try copying the `config.js` file from `solutions/04-log`
into `exercises` to see if it passes the test you wrote. Then run `git reset
--hard HEAD` and copy the test files instead to see if your implementation
passes.
