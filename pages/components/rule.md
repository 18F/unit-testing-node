title: Rule class

The `Rule` class is very small, but encapsulates important logic, part of
which depends on the [slack-client npm
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slack-client). You can find it in the
[`exercise/lib/rule.js`]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/lib/rule.js) file.

If you don't have experience writing or using test doubles, testing the `Rule`
class is a great way to gain some experience. If you're looking for more of a
challenge, then move on to the next chapter.

If you've skipped to this chapter, you can establish the starting state of the
`exercise/` files for this chapter by running:

```sh
$ ./go set-rule
```

## What to expect

Each `Rule` object implements the behavior implied by each member of
`Config.rules`. This is one of the smaller classes in the system, but an
interesting one because:

- its `match()` method provides a generic interface to arbitrarily complex
  boolean logic
- that can be broken down into multiple smaller methods, and
- it uses an object from another package to implement part of its decision
  logic that
- we will simulate using a [test
  double](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2013/07/testing-on-toilet-know-your-test-doubles.html).

## Building a `Rule` object

The beginning of the `rule.js` file, where the `Rule` constructor is defined,
looks like this:

```js
/* jshint node: true */
'use strict';

module.exports = Rule;

function Rule(configRule) {
  for (var property in configRule) {
    if (configRule.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
      this[property] = configRule[property];
    }
  }
}
```

When the `Rule` object is constructed, it assigns every property from
`configRule` to itself. The
[`hasOwnProperty()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty)
check ensures only properties defined by the configuration rule itself are
copied.

`configRule` should come from the `rules` property of a `Config` object, i.e.
`config.rules`. As discussed in the previous chapter, the `Config` object
validates the entire configuration, so there is no need for this object to
validate the rule. (Arguably we _could have_ designed the `Rule` object to
perform its own validation. Perhaps in a future release it will.)

## Testing that a `Rule` contains all the properties from the configuration

Open up the
[`exercise/test/rule-test.js`]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/test/rule-test.js)
file in your favorite editor. You should see this:

```js
/* jshint node: true */
/* jshint mocha: true */
/* jshint expr: true */

'use strict';

describe('Rule', function() {
  it('should contain all the fields from the configuration', function() {
  });
});
```

The first thing we want to do is to make sure that the `Rule` constructor
builds a valid object without errors. We'll also need to import the Chai
assertion framework. Update the top of the file to reflect the following
`require` statements:

```js
var Rule = require('../lib/rule');
var chai = require('chai');
var expect = chai.expect;
```

Then add an implementation to the `'should contain all the fields from the
configuration'` test. Pass a data object into the `Rule` constructor, and
verify that the new `Rule` object contains the same data as the original JSON
object.

The most expedient comparison is to use
[`JSON.stringify()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)
on both objects and to compare the result. It's a blunt instrument, but for
our small case, it gets the job done. In this test, we'll use the `expect`
form of [Chai BDD-style assertions](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/).

The test should look something like:

```js
  it('should contain all the fields from the configuration', function() {
    var configRule = {
          // Add valid configuration rule data here, using
          // exercises/test/helpers/test-config.json as a model.
        },
        rule = new Rule(configRule);
    expect(JSON.stringify(rule)).to.eql(JSON.stringify(configRule));
  });
```

Verify that the tests passes by running `npm test`. To limit the output to just the `Rule` tests, run it as `npm test -- --grep '^Rule '`:

```sh
$ npm test -- --grep '^Rule '

> 18f-unit-testing-node@0.0.0 test .../unit-testing-node
> gulp test "--grep" "^Rule "

[17:24:28] Using gulpfile .../unit-testing-node/gulpfile.js
[17:24:28] Starting 'test'...


  Rule
    âœ“ should contain all the fields from the configuration


  1 passing (4ms)

[17:24:29] Finished 'test' after 59 ms
```

Good tests fail when they should, so at this point, verify that the test
fails by altering the `configRule` object after the `Rule` is created:

```js
    delete configRule.reactionName;
```

Then running the test again should produce:

```sh
$ npm test -- --grep '^Rule '

> 18f-unit-testing-node@0.0.0 test .../unit-testing-node
> gulp test "--grep" "^Rule "

[17:26:57] Using gulpfile .../unit-testing-node/gulpfile.js
[17:26:57] Starting 'test'...


  Rule
    1) should contain all the fields from the configuration


  0 passing (10ms)
  1 failing

  1) Rule should contain all the fields from the configuration:

      AssertionError: expected '{"reactionName":"evergreen_tree","githubRepository":"hub","channelNames":["hub"]}' to deeply equal '{"githubRepository":"hub","channelNames":["hub"]}'
      + expected - actual

      -{"reactionName":"evergreen_tree","githubRepository":"hub","channelNames":["hub"]}
      +{"githubRepository":"hub","channelNames":["hub"]}

    at Context.<anonymous> (exercise/test/rule-test.js:20:37)




[17:26:57] 'test' errored after 65 ms
[17:26:57] Error in plugin 'gulp-mocha'
Message:
    1 test failed.
npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
```

Now that we're confident the test will fail when it should, remove the
alteration so that the test passes again.

## Designing the `Rule.match()` method

The `match()` method needs to inspect a `reaction_added` message and return
`true` if the rule applies. The format of a `reaction_added` message is:

```json
{
  "type": "reaction_added",
  "user": "U024BE7LH",
  "item": {
    "type": "message",
    "channel": "C2147483705",
    "ts": "1360782804.083113"
  },
  "reaction": "evergreen_tree",
  "event_ts": "1360782804.083113"
}
```

Therefore, the rule should match if:

- the message's `reaction` value matches `Rule.reactionName`
- `Rule.channelNames` is undefined, _or_ the message's `item.channel` value
  is a member of `Rule.channelNames`

Even though this could all be written as a single function, these concerns are
different enough that we've extracted them into separate functions:

```js
Rule.prototype.match = function(message, slackClient) {
  return (this.reactionMatches(message) &&
    this.channelMatches(message, slackClient));
};
```

This not only makes the `match()` method easier to understand, but also makes
it easy to add new conditions to `match()` one day should the need arise.

## Testing `Rule.reactionMatches()`

This is the easy one. It only needs to check that the message's `reaction`
matches `Rule.reactionName`. However, before we write the test, let's hoist
the `configRule` from the previous test into a helper method in the fixture:

```js
describe('Rule', function() {
  var makeConfigRule = function() {
    return {
      reactionName: 'evergreen_tree',
      githubRepository: 'hub',
      channelNames: ['hub']
    };
  };

  it('should contain all the fields from the configuration', function() {
    var configRule = makeConfigRule(),
        rule = new Rule(configRule);
    expect(JSON.stringify(rule)).to.eql(JSON.stringify(configRule));
  });
});
```

Remember, we've wrapped the data in a method so that each test gets a
different copy, which keeps the tests isolated from one another. Make sure the
test still passes, then add a new test called `'should match a message from
one of the channelNames'`, using the sample message from above:

```js
  it('should match a message from one of the channelNames', function() {
    var rule = new Rule(makeConfigRule()),
        message = {
          type: 'reaction_added',
          user: 'U024BE7LH',
          item: {
            type: 'message',
            channel: 'C2147483705',
            ts: '1360782804.083113'
          },
          reaction: 'evergreen_tree',
          'event_ts': '1360782804.083113'
        };
    expect(rule.match(message)).to.be.true;
  });
```

Notice that we're actually still calling `rule.match()` instead of
`rule.reactionMatches()`. This is a judgment call given the relatively
straightforward `Rule.match()` algorithm. However, should it grow more
complex, we can later test each individual component of the algorithm in
isolation. [This will give us confidence that all the corner cases are
accounted for, without an exponential explosion in the number of test
cases](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/02/in-movie-amadeus-austrian-emperor.html).

Run the tests. Since we've yet to implement either `reactionMatches()` or
`channelMatches()`, this test should fail. Now add an implementation for
`reactionMatches()` that compares the message's `reaction` against the
`Rule`'s `reactionName`.

Run the test. The test should still fail. This is because `channelMatches()`
doesn't yet return anything, causing `rule.match()` to return `undefined`. For
now, just update `channelMatches()` to return `true` unconditionally. (No,
this isn't correct behavior. We will account for this very shortly.) Once the
test passes, we're ready to move on.

Now add a new test called `'should ignore a message if its name does not
match'`. Before we fill it in, let's hoist the sample message out of the
previous test and into the fixture. Make sure the tests continue to pass after
doing so:

```js
describe('Rule', function() {
  // makeConfigRule() definition

  var makeMessage = function() {
    return {
      type: 'reaction_added',
      user: 'U024BE7LH',
      item: {
        type: 'message',
        channel: 'C2147483705',
        ts: '1360782804.083113'
      },
      reaction: 'evergreen_tree',
      'event_ts': '1360782804.083113'
    };
  };

  // other tests...

  it('should match a message from one of the channelNames', function() {
    var rule = new Rule(makeConfigRule()),
        message = makeMessage();
    expect(rule.match(message)).to.be.true;
  });
```

It should begin slightly differently from the earlier test, in order
to exercise the condition that the message names don't match. In this case
we're updating the `configRule`. Alternatively, you can change
`message.reaction` instead.

```js
  it('should should ignore a message if its name does not match', function() {
    var configRule = makeConfigRule(),
        message = makeMessage(),
        rule;

    configRule.reactionName = 'sad-face';
    rule = new Rule(configRule);

    expect(rule.match(message)).to.be.false;
  });
```

Run the test. When it passes, move on to the next section.

## Testing `Rule.channelMatches()`

First, the easy case. Add a test called `'should match a message from any
channel'`. Copy the implementation from `'should match a message from one of
the channelNames'`, then add this line before the `expect()` clause:

```js
    delete rule.channelNames;
```

Run the test. It should pass. Now add another test called `'should ignore a
message if its channel doesn\'t match'`. Copy the implementation from the
previous test, except change two things:

- Remove the `delete rule.channelNames` line.
- Change `to.be.true` condition to `to.be.false`.

Run the test. It should fail. This because we made `channelMatches()` always
return `true` to get the earlier test to pass. Our goal now is to get the new
test to pass, while making sure all the previous tests continue to pass.

## Implementing `channelMatches()`

`channelMatches()` will not be very complex, but certainly more complex than
`reactionMatches()`. It needs to ensure the following:

- If the `Rule` does not have any `channelNames` defined, it should always
  return `true`.
- Otherwise, it should only return `true` if the channel from the message
  matches one of the `channelNames`.

Go ahead and implement the first condition, ensuring that the previous test
still passes. To get the new test to pass, there is a bit of a wrinkle to
handle first.

## The external Slack client dependency

The incoming `reaction_added` message has a `item.channel` property, but it's
encoded as a unique identifier. However, in our configuration, we use a
human-readable array of `channelNames`. In order to implement
`channelMatches`, we need to translate the identifier to a human-readable
name. In production, we will rely on the slack-client instance passed in from
Hubot to perform this translation.

## Using a stub for the external Slack client interface

We have a number of options to simulate this functionality in our unit test in
a fast, controllable, yet reliable fashion using a test double:

- We can create a Slack client _stub_ to pass into `rule.match()` and hardcode
  it to return a particular value.
- We can use a test double library to generate such a stub for us.
- We can introduce a new abstraction for the Slack client.

In this situation, any of the three could reasonably suffice. Thinking ahead
regarding the needs of the application, we know that other parts of the
application will depend on this Slack interface as well. This would favor the
third option.

However, since this is such a small example, we'll create our own stub for
Slack client for now. This also helps to illustrate some of the concepts
behind test stubs before we use a more complex library like
[sinon](http://sinonjs.org/). Add this to the file before the
`describe('Rule')` declaration:

```js
function SlackClientStub(channelName) {
  this.channelName = channelName;
}

SlackClientStub.prototype.getChannelByID = function(channelId) {
  this.channelId = channelId;
  return { name: this.channelName };
};
```

This stub hardcodes the `channelName` that `getChannelByID` will return.
The actual slack-client object returns a `Channel` instance that contains a
`name` property, so we simulate that with a small JavaScript object.
`SlackClientStub` also records the `channelId` passed to the stub, so that we
can validate the the argument passed by the code under test.

## Applying `SlackClientStub` to the test

Equipped with the stub, we can now get the test to pass. Update the test to
look like this:

```js
  it('should ignore a message if its channel doesn\'t match', function() {
    var rule = new Rule(makeConfigRule()),
        message = makeMessage(),
        slackClient = new SlackClientStub('not-the-hub');

    expect(rule.match(message, slackClient)).to.be.false;
    expect(slackClient.channelId).to.eql(message.item.channel);
  });
```

Run the test and make sure it fails. Now update `channelMatches()` to
implement the second condition, where the function will return `true` if the
`message.item.channel` translates to one of the names in `this.channelNames`,
using `SlackClient.getChannelByID()` to translate. (Hint: use
[`Array.prototype.indexOf()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf).)

When you're finished, run the tests again. Notice that `'should ignore a
message if its channel doesn\'t match'` passes, but `'should match a message
from one of the channelNames'` fails.

```sh
$ npm test -- --grep '^Rule '

> 18f-unit-testing-node@0.0.0 test .../unit-testing-node

```

It's failing because now the earlier test is actually exercising the new code
path we just introduced into `channelMatches()`. In this case, it's the test
itself that needs updating, not the code under test. Update all the tests that
call `rule.match()` with the following declaration:

```js
        // previous var declarations...
        slackClient = new SlackClientStub('hub');
```

Then update all of the `rule.match(message)` calls to read
`rule.match(message, slackClient)`. And for good measure, add these assertions
to all of the affected tests as well:

```js
    // For tests that should exercise the new channelMatches() logic.
    expect(slackClient.channelId).to.eql(message.item.channel);

    // For all other tests calling rule.match().
    expect(slackClient.channelId).to.be.undefined;
```

## Check your work

By this point, all of the `Rule` tests should be passing:

Now that you're all finished, compare your solutions to the code in
[`solutions/01-rule/lib/rule.js`]({{ site.baseurl }}/solutions/01-rule/lib/rule.js)
and
[`solutions/01-rule/test/rule-test.js`]({{ site.baseurl }}/solutions/01-rule/test/rule-test.js).

You may wish to `git commit` your work to your local repo at this point. After
doing so, try copying the `config.js` file from `solutions/01-rule` into
`exercises` to see if it passes the test you wrote. Then run `git reset --hard
HEAD` and copy the test files instead to see if your implementation passes.
