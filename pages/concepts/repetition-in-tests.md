Contrary to the application of the [Don't Repeat Yourself
(DRY) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) in
production code, well-crafted repetition can make for a more understandable
test suite. The trick is to repeat enough context that any test may be largely
understood on its own, while the differences between tests stand out.
