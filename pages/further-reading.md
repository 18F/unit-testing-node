Before or after reading this guide, read our [Automated Testing
Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/automated-testing-playbook) for more context,
or the [Testing Cookbook](https://pages.18f.gov/testing-cookbook/) for more
details about the automated testing tools and techniques available for
different languages.

Several of the posts at [The Node Way](http://thenodeway.io/) also strongly
influenced the design of this guide's application, specifically:

- [Understanding Error-First
  Callbacks](http://thenodeway.io/posts/understanding-error-first-callbacks/)
- [Testing Essentials](http://thenodeway.io/posts/testing-essentials/)
- [Designing Custom Types](http://thenodeway.io/posts/designing-custom-types/)
